# Next.js Basics

This repository is a collection of my practice work with Next.js, focusing on exploring the full potential of app-routing. It serves as a hands-on exploration following my transition from ReactJS to Next.js, aiming to master web development techniques.

## Features

- **Basic to Advanced Routing:** Demonstrates various routing strategies including normal, parallel, and nested routing within a Next.js application.
- **Structured File System:** Utilizes a well-organized file structure with specific files for different purposes, including:
  - `page.tsx`: Entry point for pages.
  - `default.tsx`: Default layout components.
  - `layout.tsx`: Layout definition for the app.
  - `error.tsx`: Custom error handling components.
  - `not-found.tsx`: Custom 404 page.
  - `style.css` & `global-style.css`: CSS files for local and global styles.
- **Dynamic Route Segments:** Incorporates dynamic routing with Next.js using special directory names like `[]`, `()`, and `@` to handle various routing patterns.
